1. Use bash terminal to connect to the database.
2. Use the following command and password to connect:
psql -h postgres.cmf5w5wgnvbd.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U postgres
password: fWTKbeC3EtgSMy6jLQzg
3. In the database 4 schemas are created proxy_even (for storing tweets with even ids), proxy_odd (for storing tweets with odd id), sharding_a2020 (for storing tweets from 2020) and sharding_b2020 (for storing tweets before 2020).
4. Each schema contains one table, called 'table1'. To query the table of one of the shemas use one of the commands:
SELECT * FROM shard_a2020.table1;
SELECT * FROM shard_b2020.table1;
SELECT * FROM proxy_odd.table1;
SELECT * FROM proxy_even.table1;
